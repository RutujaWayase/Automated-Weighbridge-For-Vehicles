        <p><strong>This is bold</strong>A <b>flower</b>, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive<br> structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from <br>different individuals in a population) resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg<br> from the same flower) when self pollination occurs.</p>
